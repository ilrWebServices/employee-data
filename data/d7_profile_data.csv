This most recent volume applies internationally accepted human rights principles as standards for judgment and argues that the NLRA was and remains at its core a workers' rights statute.  It also shows how value clashes and choices between those who interpret the NLRA as a workers' rights statute and those who contend that the NLRA seeks only a ""balance"" between the economic interests of labor and management have been major influences in the evolution of the NLRB and the law.  Rights Not Interests contends, contrary to many who would write its obituary, that the NLRA is not dead.  Instead the book concludes with a call for visionary thinking including the U.S. Constitution as a source of workers' rights.  <br><br>Professor Gross is a member of National Academy of Arbitrators and on the labor arbitration panels of the American Arbitration Association, Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and New York State Public Employment Relations Board, as well as being a panelist named in several contracts.</p>","full_html",37991,,"jag28.jpg","https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/people/jag28.jpg",28711,"Download CV","James A.

He earned bachelor's (1966) and master’s (1968) degrees in sociology from California State University, Long Beach and Los Angeles, respectively, and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Wisconsin, Madison in 1972.</p><p>Lawler has authored or co-authored three books and over 60 articles, and edited or co-edited over 20 volumes of the annual series, Advances in Group Processes.  Most recently, his book (coauthored with Shane Thye and Jeongkoo Yoon), Social Commitments in a Depersonalized World (2009) was published by the Russell Sage Foundation.  This book won the 2010 James Coleman Best Book Award from the Rationality and Society Section of the American Sociological Association.  In 2001, he received the Cooley-Mead Award for career achievement from the Social Psychology Section of the American Sociological Association, and in 2003 his paper, “An Affect Theory of Social Exchange” won the 2002 Theory Prize from the Theory Section of the American Sociological Association.  He served as Editor of Social Psychology Quarterly (1992-96); he was a Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences (1996-97) and a Scholar at the Russell Sage Foundation (2007-08).  </p><p>His primary teaching and research areas are group processes, exchange, power, negotiation, sociology of emotion, and theory.  His current research analyzes the role of emotion in social exchange and negotiations, the formation of groups, the commitment of individuals to organizations, and more generally the emergence of social order.  A central message of his work is that people develop affective ties to groups and are willing to sacrifice more for the collective welfare if they repeatedly engage in joint tasks that give them a sense of shared responsibility for group results.  His work shows how and when people come to view group or organizational memberships as important and valuable in their own right, not only because of the benefits they individually derive from membership.</p><p>He has served in various academic administrative roles. At Cornell University, he served as Dean of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations from 1997-2005 and chaired the Strategic Planning Advisory Council that created Cornell’s Strategic Plan for 2010-2015. At the University of Iowa, he chaired the Department of Sociology (1983-89), chaired a university self study (1986-87) and strategic planning process (1989) and was President of the Faculty Senate (1992-93). Professionally, he chaired the Social Psychology (1997-98) and Rational Choice (19990-2000) Sections of the American Sociological Association, and was President of Research Committee (42) on Social Psychology of the International Sociological Association (1998-2002).</p>","full_html",28851,,"ejl3.jpg","https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/people/ejl3.jpg",,,,,"Complex organizations;Conflict Resolution;Employee Relations;Group dynamics and processes;Negotiations;Organizations;Strategic planning;Strategic tactics;Theory and behavior;Theory and models","ower and Bargaining in Organizations, Decision-making and conflict resolution, Group Solidarity, Emotion in Relations and Groups",

Her research focuses on the confluence of organizational practices, leadership behaviors, and climate for inclusion on individual- and group-level outcomes. Using multi-level and multi-method research designs across a number of large-scale federally funded projects, she has found that leaders play an important role in shaping inclusion. In particular, the extent to which leaders role model inclusive behaviors, clarify the learning and innovation benefits of diversity for the group’s work, and set strong norms related to interpersonal interactions, determines the inclusiveness of their workgroup climates. In turn, workgroup climate has important implications for the authenticity of the relationship that group members develop, the positive versus negative quality of relational ties, the information that is shared among group members, the extent of conflict that is experienced, and ultimately the creativity, financial performance, and turnover rates associated with these groups.

Rissing studies regulatory, mobility, and social processes that operate behind the scenes to shape important facets of modern careers.  These topics include how government regulators affect immigrant hiring and compensation, the performance implications of worker mobility, and the functioning of new organizational recruitment systems reliant on social connections.  For his research, he negotiates access to, and analyzes, unique personnel data within U.S. government agencies, for-profit businesses, and university admissions systems, which often encompass millions of observations.  Using modern data analytics, he builds datasets by joining disparate administrative, application, and employee records.  Rissing uses these data to test theories with key implications for governments, workers, and practitioners.  <br><br>Dr. Rissing earned his doctorate in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Sloan School of Management; master’s degrees in management science and engineering management from MIT and Duke University, respectively; and a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Virginia.

I argue that, as rural America industrialized, the built environment and bodies of workers became conceived of as part of nature and these natural forces were mobilized to increase the scale and efficiency of production in the forest. The fulcrum of my argument is a 1904 scientific study of loggers’ diet that shows how the invention of the calorie and nutritional sciences allowed the metabolism of industrial workers to be refined and exploited as a natural force to speed up the labor process in the forest.</p>","full_html",81601,,"Jason-Newton-2017.jpg","https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/people/Jason-Newton-2017.jpg",80386,"Download the CV","Jason_Newton_CV_9.2017.pdf","https://archive.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/fielduploads/entityform_web_services_request_form/file_upload_general/Jason_Newton_CV_9.2017.pdf",,,"<ul class=""links"">

He received his Ph.D. from New York University, and has held fellowships at Harvard University, the New School and the New York Historical Society. His writing has been published in the journal American Historical Review.<br><br>Nagaraja’s research and teaching explores the intersections of U.S. labor and African American and foreign relations history. Investigating both ‘top-down’ public policy and ‘bottom-up’ social movements, his work considers how class, gender and race evolve within a changing global division of labor and geopolitics. As a scholar of empire, he interprets the United States both in and of the world, across both connection and comparison, especially through a focus on war and the military. As a historian of labor and racial capitalism, he finds the study of social movements particularly illuminating. In addition to labor and working-class history, Nagaraja’s teaching has highlighted the Black freedom movement and U.S. wars, including interdisciplinary courses on global capitalism, on race and war — as well as, gender and geopolitics; the military- and prison- industrial complex; freedom struggles in geopolitics; intersectional and international social movements.<br><b> </b><br>Nagaraja is writing a book about America’s World War II experience and generation. It reconstructs a far-flung war within the war, among Americans themselves. This transnational story braids military-industrial labor battles, Black soldiers’ protest against policing and incarceration, and veterans’ debates about America’s role in the world. Diverse war workers led a ‘greatest generation’ of labor, Black freedom and other social movements, which linked racial and economic and global contentions. These struggles took place from Pennsylvania to Panama, Georgia to Germany, Michigan to Manila. From WWII into the Cold War, U.S. foreign policy’s statecraft was entangled and embattled in relation with domestic social movements, which were themselves embedded within the new global war machine. This process took shape amidst a singular peak momentum in the organization and intersection of the U.S. labor and Black movements, as they intersected with a singular peak momentum in the organization of U.S. global military power. As Americans today grapple with the overlapping trajectories from New Deal to neo-liberalism, from Jim Crow to a prison-industrial complex, from American primacy to a military-industrial complex—this book finds the WWII generation’s war-within-war to be critically foundational and revealing.</p>","full_html",108910,"Tejasvi Nagaraja","NagarajaT_web.jpg","https://www.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/NagarajaT_web.jpg",108911,"Nagaraja CV 2020","Tej cv 2020.pdf","https://archive.ilr.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/faculty/vitas/Tej cv 2020.pdf","Affirmative action;Comparative labor movements;Discrimination;Diversity and Inclusion;Labor History;Labor and politics;Labor and society;Labor rights;Organizing;Rights of working people;Unions;Urban labor movements;Workplace democracy",,"<ul class=""links"">

Garay's second book project titled <i>Labor Coalitions in Unequal Societies</i>, will explain why coalitions between labor unions and movements of informal-sector, rural and/or unemployed workers have formed in some developing countries but not others. In another book project, she studies social policy expansion in Latin America and other regions of the Global South.
